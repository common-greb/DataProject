# I wrote this code in Spyder, at the recommendation of my brother who works in data science. I found I really like the interface, and I really appreciate being able to see my variables easily. And the visualisations were really nice. After I finished I copied it into VSCode and commited.

# This shows how many words are in each movie title.

# This was an attempt to weed out movies that have the series they are a part of in their title. (E.g. - Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace) Titles like these have a lot of words, and I didn't want them to be included in my plot of movie name length over time. Not ideal though, as these movies are really popular these days...
