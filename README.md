This was a bit of fun, which is annoying. I really wanted to hate this assignment, and do the bear minimum to pass the class. But damn it, coding can be fun. My brother works in Data science so he was a big help for me here. I'm really bad at coding, but Tim, google, and stack overflow were a massive help. I didn't even use ChatGPT for this assignment, which is wild because it totally carried me through the rest of this class.

With a little bit of help, this really wasn't so hard. I absolutely understand all the code I wrote, and I see the value that simple coding and data analysis could bring to my design degree and career. Good stuff.

What made this really interesting was my topic. Oh, how horrible this assignment would have been if I had to analyze financial dreck. I love movies, I love learning about movies, so naturally this was pretty cool. And I love doing fun presentations, so that was really the best part. I think smart graphs and visual aids can really bring an interesting presentation to the next level. Make it not just fun, but a bit informative.
